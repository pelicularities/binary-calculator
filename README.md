# Binary Calculator
Inspired by the HackerRank challenge [Binary Calculator](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-binary-calculator?hr_b=1).

The Binary Calculator challenge on HackerRank is a lot of fun, but if you build something that meets the bare minimum of the HackerRank spec:
- there's no error handling
- you _must_ press C between calculations
- you can't use the keyboard to operate the calculator
- it's kind of ugly

So: this is just a little additional challenge for me to build a binary calculator that looks good and works well.
